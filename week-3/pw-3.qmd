Q1. Define and explain the following terms:

- Random phenomenon

- Statistical experiment

- Random event

- Sample space

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

- **Random phenomenon**: It is described as a situation in which we know what outcomes can occur, 
but whose precise outcome is not certainly known. 

- **Statistical experiment**: It is a procedure that has a clearly defined set of possible outcomes 
and can be repeated under identical conditions, where each outcome occurs by chance. 

- **Random event**: It is an outcome or a group of outcomes from a random experiment 
whose result cannot be predicted with certainty before the experiment is performed. 
Even if the experiment is repeated under the same conditions, 
it can produce different outcomes each time due to chance.

- **Sample space**: It is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. 
It encompasses every potential result that can occur, 
providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing probabilities.

Q2. What is probability? Discuss its importance.

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

Probability is a fundamental concept in statistics, 
playing a crucial role in understanding and quantifying uncertainty in various phenomena.

It's importance lies in its ability to support informed decision-making. 
Probability allows statisticians and researchers to make predictions about future events, 
draw inferences about a population based on sample data, and assess the reliability of those inferences. 
It also forms the foundation for many statistical methods, 
including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. 
Overall, probability is essential for modeling randomness, managing risk, 
and making sound conclusions in the presence of uncertainty.

**Answer**

1.
| Elementary Event                             | Compound Event                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| An event that consists of a single outcome.      | An event that consists of two or more outcomes.           |

Q4. Three unbiased coins are tossed. Calculate the probability of:

- All heads

- Two heads

- One head

- At least one head

- At least two heads

- All tails

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

The sample space for 3 unbiased coin tosses is $2^3 = 8$ outcomes, 
since each coin has 2 possible results (Head or Tail):

    C3 --> D5[THH]
    C3 --> D6[THT]
    C4 --> D7[TTH]
    C4 --> D8[TTT]

Each coin has two outcomes: Head $\small{(H = 1)}$ or Tail $\small{(T = 0)}$

# Binomial Distribution

In a coin toss experiment, each toss is a Bernoulli trial (success = heads with probability $\small{p}$ , failure = tails with probability $\small{1-p}$).

The binomial distribution models the probability of getting exactly $\small{k}$ successes (e.g., heads) in $\small{n}$ 
independent tosses.

- The probability mass function (PMF) gives the probability of getting exactly $\small{k}$ heads: $\small{P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1 - p)^{n - k}}$

-  The cumulative distribution function (CDF) gives the probability of getting at most $\small{k}$ heads: $\small{P(X \le k) = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{n}{i} p^i (1 - p)^{n - i}}$

This will be covered further in the binomial distribution section.

Julia uses the `//` operator to create exact [rational numbers](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/complex-and-rational-numbers/#Rational-Numbers) as ratios of integers.

:::

```{julia}
# Create PMF and CDF functions

my_pmf(k::Int64; n::Int64=3, p::Rational=1//2) = binomial(n, k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n - k)

my_cdf(k::Int64; n::Int64=3, p::Rational=1//2) = sum(binomial(n, i) * p^i * (1 - p)^(n - i) for i in 0:k)

```

:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}

In Julia, functions can include [keyword arguments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/#Keyword-Arguments) that provide default values.

For example, in the function `my_pmf(k::Int64; n::Int64=3, p::Rational=1//2)`, `n` and `p` are keyword arguments with default values of `3` and `1/2`, respectively.

These can be overridden by specifying them explicitly when calling the function, like `my_pmf(2; n=5, p=2//3)`

Q5. A card is drawn from a well-shuffled deck of 52 cards. 
Determine the probability of drawing a card that is neither a heart nor a king.

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

We need to find the probability of drawing a card that is neither a heart nor a king, i.e., $\small{P(\text{Neither a heart nor a king})}$:

- Total cards = $\small{52}$

- Hearts = $\small{13}$, Kings = $\small{4}$

- The king of hearts is counted twice, so we subtract $\small{1}$ to avoid double-counting

- Cards that are hearts or kings = $\small{13 + 4 - 1 = 16}$

- Cards that are neither = $\small{52 - 16 = 36}$

- Therefore, $\small{P(\text{Neither a heart nor a king}) = \dfrac{36}{52} = \dfrac{9}{13}}$


```{julia}
# Given data
deck = 52
kings = 4
hearts = 13
king_hearts = 1

# Cards that are neither a heart or a king
heart_nor_king = deck - (kings + hearts - king_hearts)

# Probability
p = heart_nor_king // deck

println("The P(neither a heart nor a king): $p")

| Selection Type | Group A        | Group B        | Group C        | Probability(A * B * C) |
|----------------|--------------- |----------------|----------------|------------------------|
| M W W          | $\small{\dfrac{3}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{2}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{3}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{18}{64}}$       |
| W M W          | $\small{\dfrac{1}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{2}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{3}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{6}{64}}$        |
| W W M          | $\small{\dfrac{1}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{2}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{1}{4}}$ | $\small{\dfrac{2}{64}}$        |

Q11. What is the probability that a randomly selected leap year will contain 53 Sundays?

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

- A leap year has 366 days, which is equivalent to 52 full weeks and 2 extra days.

- So, since 52 Sundays are guaranteed, the probability of getting 53 Sundays depends on which two days the extra days fall on.

- The two extra days in a leap year can be any of the following 7 combinations: $\small{\text{Sample space} = \{\text{Su-Mo}, \text{Mo-Tu}, \text{Tu-We}, \text{We-Th}, \text{Th-Fr}, \text{Fr-Sa}, \text{Sa-Su}\}}$

- So out of 7 possible combinations, 2 contain a Sunday.

- Final Probability:

  $\small{P(53\ \text{Sundays}) = \dfrac{2}{7}}$

```{julia}
# Total number of possible extra day combinations in a leap year
total_outcomes = 7

# Favorable outcomes: (Saturday, Sunday) and (Sunday, Monday)
favorable_outcomes = 2

# Probability
prob_53_sundays = favorable_outcomes // total_outcomes

println("P(53 Sundays) = $prob_53_sundays")

Q12. A university has to select an examiner from a list of 50 persons, which includes 20 women and 30 men, 10 who know Hindi and 40 who do not, 15 teachers and 35 non-teachers. What is the probability of selecting a Hindi-knowing woman teacher?

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

Given:

- Total people = 5

- Women = 2

- Hindi-knowing = 1

- Teachers = 15

Probability that a randomly selected person is a hindi knowing woman teacher, assuming each trait is independent since no overlap is specified: $\small{P(\text{Hindi-knowing} \cap \text{Woman} \cap \text{Teacher}) = \dfrac{10}{50} \times \dfrac{20}{50} \times \dfrac{15}{50} = \dfrac{3000}{125000} = \dfrac{3}{125}}$

```{julia}
# Total people
total = 50

# Individual probabilities
p_hindi     = 10 // total
p_woman     = 20 // total
p_teacher   = 15 // total

# Final probability assuming independence
p_all_three = p_hindi * p_woman * p_teacher

println("P(Hindi-knowing woman teacher) = $p_all_three")

Q13. A hospital has two departments for conducting medical tests. Department A conducts 80% of the tests, while Department B conducts 20% of the tests. In Department A, 85 out of 100 tests are accurate. In Department B, 65 out of 100 tests are accurate. What is the probability that a randomly selected accurate test came from Department A?

:::{.content-`{julia} answers`}

**Answer**

Using Bayes' Theorem, $\small{P(\text{Dept A} \mid \text{Accurate})}$

Define Events:

- $A$: Test from Department A

- $B$: Test from Department B

- $Acc$: Test is accurate

Given Probabilities:

- $\small{P(A) = \dfrac{80}{100} = 0.8}$

- $\small{P(B) = \dfrac{20}{100} = 0.2}$

- $\small{P(\text{Acc} \mid A) = \dfrac{85}{100} = 0.85}$

- $\small{P(\text{Acc} \mid B) = \dfrac{65}{100} = 0.6}5$


Use Bayes' Theorem: $\small{P(A \mid \text{Acc}) = \dfrac{P(\text{Acc})}{P(\text{Acc} \mid A) \cdot P(A)}}$

  Where: $\small{P(\text{Acc}) = P(\text{Acc} \mid A) \cdot P(A) + P(\text{Acc} \mid B) \cdot P(B)}$

Thus, 
  
  $\small{P(\text{Acc}) = (0.85 \cdot 0.8) + (0.65 \cdot 0.2) = 0.68 + 0.13 = 0.81}$

  $\small{P(A \mid \text{Acc}) = \dfrac{0.85 \cdot 0.8}{0.81} = \dfrac{0.68}{0.81} = \dfrac{68}{81}}$


```{julia}
# Given data
p_A = 80//100
p_B = 20//100

p_acc_given_A = 85//100
p_acc_given_B = 65//100

# Total probability of accuracy
p_acc = p_acc_given_A * p_A + p_acc_given_B * p_B

# Bayes' theorem: P(A | Accurate)
p_A_given_acc = (p_acc_given_A * p_A) // p_acc

println("P(Dept A | Accurate) = $p_A_given_acc")

Q14. A brother and sister apply for two positions in a healthcare research project. The probability of the brother being selected is 1/7, and the probability of the sister being selected is 1/5. What is the probability that:

- Both of them will be selected

- Only one of them will be selected

- None of them will be selected

- At least one of them will be selected

Mutually Exclusive Events: 

$\small{P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)}$; $\small{{P(A \cup B) = \text{A or B (either or both occur)}}}$

Multiplication Theorem for Independent Events: 

$\small{P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)}$; $\small{P(A \cap B) = \text{A or B (both occur)}}$

Note these formulas for the following questions.

:::

Given:

- Probability of the brother being selected: $\small{P(B) = \dfrac{1}{7}}$

- Probability of the sister being selected: $\small{P(S) = \dfrac{1}{5}}$

- Probability of the brother not being selected: $\small{P(\overline{B}) = \dfrac{6}{7}}$

- Probability of the sister not being selected: $\small{P(\overline{S}) = \dfrac{4}{5}}$

```{julia}
#| output: false
# Given probabilities
P_B = 1 // 7
P_S = 1 // 5
P_not_B = 6 // 7
P_not_S = 4 // 5
```

- $\small{P(\text{Both selected}) = P(B) \times P(S) = \dfrac{1}{7} \times \dfrac{1}{5} = \dfrac{1}{35}}$

```{julia}
P_both_selected = P_B * P_S

println("P(Both of them will be selected): $P_both_selected")
```

- $\small{P(\text{Only one selected}) = P(B) \times P(\overline{S}) + P(\overline{B}) \times P(S) = \dfrac{1}{7} \times \dfrac{4}{5} + \dfrac{6}{7} \times \dfrac{1}{5} = \dfrac{10}{35} = \dfrac{2}{7}}$

```{julia}
P_only_one_selected = P_B * P_not_S + P_not_B * P_S

println("P(Only one of them will be selected): $P_only_one_selected")
```

- $\small{P(\text{None selected}) = P(\overline{B}) \times P(\overline{S}) = \dfrac{6}{7} \times \dfrac{4}{5} = \dfrac{24}{35}}$

```{julia}
P_none_selected = P_not_B * P_not_S

println("P(None of them will be selected): $P_none_selected")
```

- $\small{P(\text{At least one selected}) = 1 - P(\text{None selected}) = 1 - \dfrac{24}{35} = \dfrac{11}{35}}$

```{julia}
P_at_least_one_selected = 1 - P_none_selected

println("P(At least one of them will be selected): $P_at_least_one_selected")
```
