43 60 39

Summarize weights in the form of a frequency distribution.

::: {.content-`{julia} answers`} 

**Answer**

```{julia}
# Given data
weights = [67 34 36 48 49 31 61 34 43 45 38 32 27 61 29 47 36 50 46 30 40 32 30 33 45 49 48 41 53 36 37 47 47 30 50 28 35 35 38 36 46 43 34 62 69 50 28 44 43 60 39]

#Find the minimum and maximum of data to define intervals
min_value = minimum(weights) #27
max_value = maximum(weights) #69

# Define intervals
interval = collect(25:5:70)

# Create arrays to hold interval labels and frequencies
interval_label = String[]
frequency = Int[]

# Loop to calculate frequencies and store them in arrays
for i in 1:length(interval)-1
    lower, upper = interval[i], interval[i+1]
    count_range = count(x -> lower <= x < upper,weights)

Q19. In a recent study of causes of death in men 60 years of age and older, a sample of 120 men indicated that 48 died as a result of some form of heart disease.

Develop a descriptive statistic that can be used as an estimate of the percentage of men 60 years of age or older who die from some form of heart disease

Are the data on the causes of death qualitative or quantitative?

::: {.content-`{julia} answers`} 

**Answer**

A useful descriptive statistic in this case is the proportion (or percentage) of men aged 60 and older who died from heart disease. It can be calculated as:

```{julia}
# given data
n_heart_disease = 48
n_total = 120

# calculate percentage
percentage = (n_heart_disease / n_total) * 100

print("The percentage of men who died from heart disease is $percentage%")
```

The data on causes of death are qualitative (categorical) because they classify deaths into categories (e.g., heart disease, cancer, accidents, etc.) rather than being numerical measurements.

Q22. The distribution of heights of all students in the university has two peaks or is bimodal. The distribution of the IQs of the same students, however, has only one peak. How is this possible since the same students are considered in both the cases? Explain.

::: {.content-`{julia} answers`} 

**Answer**

Although the same students are considered, the bimodal distribution in height arises from biological differences, while the unimodal distribution in IQ reflects a uniform cognitive distribution across the population.

## Q.18 Understanding the code

***Histogram visualization:***

Step 1: Define the data

```{julia}
weights = vec([67 34 36 48 49 31 61 34 43 45 38 32 27 61 29 47 36 50 46 30 40 32 30 33 45 49 48 41 53 36 37 47 47 30 50 28 35 35 38 36 46 43 34 62 69 50 28 44 43 60 39])
```

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
A `DataFrame` is a series of vectors. Therefore, it requires the `Matrix` to be converted to a `Vector` using the function `vec()` before creating a `DataFrame`.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DataFrames

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
A DataFrame is a table-like structure used in Julia to store and manipulate structured data. It is part of the [`DataFrames.jl`](https://dataframes.juliadata.org/stable/man/getting_started/) or [`DataFramesMeta.jl`](https://juliadata.org/DataFramesMeta.jl/stable/) and can be worked with similarly to excel tables and SQL databases.

Simple example to create a DataFrame:

```{julia}
df = DataFrame(
    ID = [1, 2],
    Patient = ["John Doe", "Jane Doe"],
    Drug = ["Paracetamol", "Amoxicillin"],
    Dose_mg = [500, 250],
)
display(df)
```
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Convert the Data into a `DataFrame`

```{julia}
df_hist = DataFrame(Weight = weights) 
```

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
For plotting with `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` and `CairoMakie.jl`, data can be in arrays or tuples, but using a DataFrame is preferred for structured mapping and easier visualization.
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Plots

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
Julia has multiple plotting libraries, and `AlgebraOfGraphics.jl` (AoG) combined with `CairoMakie.jl` provides a powerful and flexible way to create professional-quality visualizations.

To learn how to create plots in Julia, refer to [Pumas Tutorials](https://tutorials.pumas.ai/html/PlottingInJulia/)
:::

Step 3: Create and Draw a Histogram

```{julia}
hist_weights = data(df_hist) * mapping(:Weight) * histogram(;bins = 9) |> draw
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
`data(df_hist)` → Uses df_hist as the data source.

`mapping(:Weight)` → Maps the "Weight" column to the x-axis.

`histogram()` → Creates a histogram to group and count values; `bins = 9` sets the number of bins (intervals) in 
the histogram to 9, determining how the data is grouped.

`*` (Multiplication) → Combines data, mapping, and visual layers.

`draw` → Passes the plot to draw() for rendering with CairoMakie.jl.
