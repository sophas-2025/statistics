It’s rapidly becoming a key language for data science and machine learning.\nIn statistics, for example, manually calculating the mean, median, variance, and performing other statistical analyses can be tedious and time-consuming, even with a calculator. This is where learning Julia becomes valuable. With its efficient syntax and powerful libraries like Statistics.jl and StatsBase.jl, Julia streamlines complex calculations, enhancing data analysis speed and accuracy. While Statistics.jl offers basic statistical functions, StatsBase.jl provides more advanced tools for modeling and statistical tests."

We assign the variable types in the function definition and equate it to the operation that calculates SSD.\nFunctions can be created without specifying types, but defining them is preferred.\nNumber type takes Integers and Floats while Vector{&lt;:Number} type takes a Vector of Number.\n\n\n\n\nQ7. Median is not affective by extreme values. Give examples in support of your answer.\nAnswer\nThe median represents the middle value of a dataset when it is arranged in ascending or descending order. Since it is based on the position of the middle value(s) rather than the actual numerical values, it is not significantly affected by extreme values (outliers).\n\n# Example \na = [10, 12, 14, 16, 18] # Dataset a\nmedian_a = median(a)\n\nb = [10, 12, 14, 16, 100] # Dataset b with an extreme value\nmedian_b = median(b)\n\nprint(\"Median of dataset a and b are $median_a and $median_b respectively.\")\n\nMedian of dataset a and b are 14.0 and 14.0 respectively.\n\n\nThe extreme value (100) does not change the median, showing its resistance to outliers.\n\nQ8.

This suggests that most employees’ travel times are fairly concentrated within this range, reducing the effect of extreme values (outliers).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe quantile() function is designed for vectors, but if working with matrices, you can convert them to a vector using vec().\n\n\n\n\nQ10. An agriculture farm sells grab bags of flower bulbs. The bags are sold by weight; thus the number of bulbs in each bag can vary depending on the varieties included.\nBelow are the number of bulbs in each of the 20 bags sampled:\n21 33 37 56 47 25 33 32 47 34\n36 23 26 33 37 26 37 37 43 45\n\nWhat are the mean and median number of bulbs per bag?\nBased on your answer, what can you conclude about the shape of the distribution of number of bulbs per bag?\n\nAnswer\n\n# Given data\nbulbs = [21 33 37 56 47 25 33 32 47 34 36 23 26 33 37 26 37 37 43 45]\n\n# Calculate mean and median\nmean_bulbs = mean(bulbs)\nmedian_bulbs = median(bulbs)\n\nprintln(\"The mean and median of the number of bulbs per bag are $mean_bulbs and $median_bulbs respectively.\")\n\nThe mean and median of the number of bulbs per bag are 35.4 and 35.0 respectively.\n\n\nThe mean and median are very close, suggesting an approximately symmetrical distribution with no strong skewness, and although a few larger values exist (e.g., 56), their effect on the mean is minimal, indicating a near-normal distribution\n\nQ11. The wholesale prices of a commodity for a week are as follows:\nDays: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nCommodity price/kg: 240 260 270 245 255 286 264\nCalculate the variance and standard deviation.\nAnswer\n\n# Given data\ncom_price = [240 260 270 245 255 286 264] # commodity in Rs/kg \n\n# Calculate variance and standard deviation\nvar_com_price = var(com_price)\nstd_com_price = std(com_price)\n\nprintln(\"The variance is: $(round(var_com_price, digits = 2)) Rs²/kg².\")\nprintln(\"The standard deviation is $(round(std_com_price, digits = 2)) Rs/kg.\")\n\nThe variance is: 240.33 Rs²/kg².\nThe standard deviation is 15.5 Rs/kg.\n\n\n\nQ12. (Continue from Q11) Suppose for next week, price/kg is just 10 more than previous week.\nCalculate the variance and standard deviation. What is your conclusion?\nAnswer\n\n# Given data \ncom_price = [240 260 270 245 255 286 264] .+ 10 # Previous week's price + Rs 10.\n\n# Calculate variance and standard deviation\nvar_com_price = var(com_price)\nstd_com_price = std(com_price)\n\nprintln(\"The variance is: $(round(var_com_price, digits = 2)) Rs²/kg².\")\nprintln(\"The standard deviation is $(round(std_com_price, digits = 2)) Rs/kg.\")\n\nThe variance is: 240.33 Rs²/kg².\nThe standard deviation is 15.5 Rs/kg.\n\n\nThe variance and standard deviation remain unchanged when all prices increase by Rs/kg 10 because they measure the spread of data, not its absolute position, meaning a constant change affects the mean but not the spread.",

Define and explain the following terms:\n\nRandom phenomenon\nStatistical experiment\nRandom event\nSample space\n\nAnswer\n\nRandom phenomenon: It is described as a situation in which we know what outcomes can occur, but whose precise outcome is not certainly known.\nStatistical experiment: It is a procedure that has a clearly defined set of possible outcomes and can be repeated under identical conditions, where each outcome occurs by chance.\nRandom event: It is an outcome or a group of outcomes from a random experiment whose result cannot be predicted with certainty before the experiment is performed. Even if the experiment is repeated under the same conditions, it can produce different outcomes each time due to chance.\nSample space: It is the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiment. It encompasses every potential result that can occur, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n---\ntitle: Coin Toss (Statistical Experiment) \n---\nflowchart TB\n  A((Coin is tossed))\n  A --&gt;|Random Phenomenon| B{Outcome}\n  B --&gt; |Random Event|C(Heads)\n  B --&gt; |Random Event|D(Tails)\n  F(\"Sample Space: {Heads,Tails}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ2. What is probability? Discuss its importance.\nAnswer\nProbability is a fundamental concept in statistics, playing a crucial role in understanding and quantifying uncertainty in various phenomena.\nIt’s importance lies in its ability to support informed decision-making. Probability allows statisticians and researchers to make predictions about future events, draw inferences about a population based on sample data, and assess the reliability of those inferences. It also forms the foundation for many statistical methods, including hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis. Overall, probability is essential for modeling randomness, managing risk, and making sound conclusions in the presence of uncertainty.\n\nQ3.

What is the probability that a randomly selected leap year will contain 53 Sundays?\nAnswer\n\nA leap year has 366 days, which is equivalent to 52 full weeks and 2 extra days.\nSo, since 52 Sundays are guaranteed, the probability of getting 53 Sundays depends on which two days the extra days fall on.\nThe two extra days in a leap year can be any of the following 7 combinations: \\(\\small{\\text{Sample space} = \\{\\text{Su-Mo}, \\text{Mo-Tu}, \\text{Tu-We}, \\text{We-Th}, \\text{Th-Fr}, \\text{Fr-Sa}, \\text{Sa-Su}\\}}\\)\nSo out of 7 possible combinations, 2 contain a Sunday.\nFinal Probability:\n\\(\\small{P(53\\ \\text{Sundays}) = \\dfrac{2}{7}}\\)\n\n\n# Total number of possible extra day combinations in a leap year\ntotal_outcomes = 7\n\n# Favorable outcomes: (Saturday, Sunday) and (Sunday, Monday)\nfavorable_outcomes = 2\n\n# Probability\nprob_53_sundays = favorable_outcomes // total_outcomes\n\nprintln(\"P(53 Sundays) = $prob_53_sundays\")\n\nP(53 Sundays) = 2//7\n\n\n\nQ12.
